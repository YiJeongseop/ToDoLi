# ToDoLi ![README image2](https://github.com/YiJeongseop/ToDoLi/assets/112690335/29c62c59-f4f6-4dc2-a7b2-0ea721df60e1)
I started studying flutter a few months ago. I heard that a simple app is good for the first app.
I thought an app that combines __calendar and to-do list__ would be good, and I made it. 
It's a really simple app, but I was able to create it with a lot of help from __SfCalendar__.

It's available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sanashi.todoli).
